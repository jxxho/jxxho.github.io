<h1>Journalism: One of the World's Most Dangerous Professions</h1>

<p>This project uses the Committee To Project Journalists data to illustrate journalism is one of the world's most 
dangerous professions. Here is their website https://cpj.org/killed/2016/</p>
<br>

<h2><u>Background of the data</u></h2>

<p>Commmitted To Project Journalist (CPJ) began compiling detailed records on journalsit deaths in 1992. 
They apply strict journalistic standards when investigating a death. In this database, CPJ includes only confirmed 
cases, they do not include journalists who were killed in accidents such as car or plane crashes. 

CPJ defines journalists as people work in print, in photographs, on radio, on television and online. They also include
staff journalists, freelancers and people cover news or comment on public affairs through any media.</p>

<p>As a result, CPJ classify deaths into three types:</p>

<p><b>1) Motive confirmed</b> - Journalists were murdered in direct reprisal for their work; were killed in crossfire
during combat situations; or were killed while carrying out dangerious assignments such as coverage of a street 
protest.</p>

<p><b>2) Motive unconfirmed</b> - The motive was unclear and still under investigation.</p>

<p><b>3) Media Workers</b> - In 2003, CPJ began documenting the deaths of media support workers, such as
translators, drivers, fixers, and administrative workers.</p>
<br>


<h2><u>Statistical Analysis and Charts</u></h2>
<p>According to the CPJ, 1,782 journalists were killed from 1992 to present around the world. From 55 in 1992 up to 102 
in 2006, down to 34 in 1996. In 2007, it was considered an exceptionally deadly year, 111 journalists were killed.
Since 2012, fewer reporters were killed, 59 died as of October 2016.</p>

<p>In the past 25 years, Iraq is the deadliest country on the average, the Philippines is the second, the third is Syria, then Mexico, Pakistan, Columbia, 
Russia, India, Somalia and Algeria.</p>

<p>The CPJ's data also shows the roles held by the victims. So, what type of journalism jobs are the most dangerous?</p>

<p>The CPJ classifys journalists role into broadcast reporter, Camera Operator, Photographer, Columnist, Editor, Internet Reporter,
Producer, Publisher and Technican.</p>

<p>Based on their investigation, type of death are classifed as:</p>
<p><b>1) Crossfire/combat-related</b> which refers to killing on a batterfield or in a military context including disputed shootings;</p>
<p><b>2) Dangerious assignment</b> which refers to deaths while covering a demonstration, riot, clashes between rival groups or government
and opposition forces and mob situations.</p>
<p><b>3) Murder</b> which refers to the targeted killing of a journalist whether premediated or spontaneous as long as the motive is to
kill the journalist for their work.</p>

<p>It looks like print reporter, editor, camera operator, photographer and broadcast reporter are high risk job as below chart.</p>

<p>The CPJ's data also indicates the source of fire which is suspected to the death. The person or entity that the CPJ has identified
as most likely responsible for the killing since 1992 to present.</p>

<p>Although the death rate is not significantly high, the fact that both female journalists and freelancers also
face risks at work.</p>
